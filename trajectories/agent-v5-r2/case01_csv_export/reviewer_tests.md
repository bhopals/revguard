**Assistant:**

No test file was added or modified by this PR (only `ledgerly/export.py` was changed, and `tests/test_ledgerly.py` has no references to export). Since there's no test content introduced in this diff, there's nothing to evaluate for test adequacy — and per the hard rule, absence of tests is not a reportable finding.

Confirmed — this test file doesn't test `export.py` at all, and it wasn't touched by the PR. There's no test content in this diff to evaluate.

**Assistant:**

Confirmed: this PR contains no test file changes at all — only `ledgerly/export.py` was added. The full pre-existing test file has no export-related tests, and the PR diff shown to me doesn't touch it. Since there is no new/modified test content to assess, there's nothing in scope for test adequacy (and per the hard rule, missing tests aren't a valid finding).

**Assistant:**

This confirms there are no tests at all for `export.py` in this PR — no test file changes are part of the diff. Since my scope is strictly test-adequacy defects within content this PR actually changes, and no test content was added or modified, there is nothing to flag.

**Tool call → Glob**

```json
{"pattern": "**/*.py"}

**Tool result:**

**Assistant:**

No other test files exist in the repo. The PR adds only `ledgerly/export.py` with zero accompanying test changes, so there is no test content within this PR's scope to evaluate for adequacy.
