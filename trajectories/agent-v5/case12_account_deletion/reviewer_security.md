**Assistant:**

Confirmed: `delete_expenses_bulk` accepts a `user_id` parameter but never uses it to scope the DELETE, unlike every other query in the codebase (`expenses.py` consistently filters by `user_id = ?`, and `delete_expense` even performs an explicit ownership check via `get_expense` before deleting).

```json
{"findings": [{"file": "ledgerly/account.py", "line": 9, "category": "security", "title": "Bulk expense delete lacks ownership scoping (IDOR)", "severity": "critical", "description": "delete_expenses_bulk(db, user_id, expense_ids) receives user_id but never uses it in the SQL statement — the DELETE only filters on `id IN (...)` with no `AND user_id = ?` clause, unlike delete_expense() in expenses.py which verifies ownership via get_expense() before deleting and every other query in the codebase which scopes by user_id. Any authenticated user can call this with expense_ids belonging to another user (e.g. guessed/enumerated sequential integer IDs) and have those other users' expenses deleted, since the row's actual owner is never checked. This is a direct IDOR / broken object-level authorization vulnerability introduced by this PR."}]}
