**Assistant:**

The PR's "Files changed" list contains only `ledgerly/expenses.py` — no test file was added or modified in this diff, and the existing test suite has no coverage for `page_count`, `count_expenses`, or the new `page_size` parameter. Since the hard rule prohibits flagging absence-of-tests as a finding, and there is no test diff content to evaluate, there is nothing in scope here.

**Assistant:**

Confirmed: this PR contains no test changes at all (the diff touches only `ledgerly/expenses.py`), and the existing test file has no tests for `page_count`, `count_expenses`, or the new `page_size` parameter. There is no test content introduced by this PR to evaluate for adequacy, so there's nothing in scope for this focus area.

**Assistant:**

This PR includes no test changes whatsoever — the diff modifies only `ledgerly/expenses.py`, and `tests/test_ledgerly.py` has no assertions covering `page_count`, `count_expenses`, or the new `page_size` parameter of `list_expenses`. Since flagging the absence of tests is out of scope, there is nothing to report here.
