**Assistant:**

Based on my review of the PR changes and tests, I've identified one test adequacy defect:

The `TestAtomicity::test_atomic_batch` test (line 69) tests only the success case of importing a valid statement. However, the PR's core feature for atomicity is described as "all-or-nothing batches, so a malformed row no longer leaves a half-imported statement behind." The test name and class name both promise atomicity testing, but the test never verifies what happens when an error occurs during import—specifically, that the entire batch is rolled back when any row fails.

The current test imports a valid statement and checks that success counts are correct and the batch is recorded. But a proper atomicity test should:
1. Attempt to import a statement with an error partway through (e.g., invalid data that causes an exception during row processing)
2. Verify that NO expenses are recorded (rolled back)
3. Verify that NO batch row is inserted

The test deliberately avoids the scenario that would expose atomicity behavior—it only tests the "happy path" where everything succeeds, which doesn't exercise the rollback logic at all.
